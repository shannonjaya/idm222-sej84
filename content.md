## Inkwell

**Subheading:** Where stories flow in ink

### Overview

- **Tools:** 
    - Figma, Jitter, Adobe After Effects

- **Timeline:** 
    - 10 Weeks

- **Role:** 
    - Solo - Interaction Design, UI/UX Design & Animation, User Flows, Prototyping, Branding

- **Deliverables:** 
    - High-Fidelity Mobile UI & Animated Prototype

- **At a glance:** 
    - I created Inkwell as a rebrand of the Goodreads app. It offers a streamlined task flow for easier book logging and new features such as reading status options like “currently reading,” “did not finish,” and 1/2 star ratings to thoughtfully accommodate different user experiences.

### Empathize

- **Understanding Goodreads**
    - Goodreads is well-known for allowing users to track books, write reviews, and interact with fellow readers. However, as a user of Goodreads myself, I noticed several flaws in its design and functionality and decided to help solve them.

### Define 

- **The pain points** 
    - I began my research by analyzing user reviews on the App Store, identifying common criticisms of Goodreads. This feedback highlighted three distinct pain points.
        - **Inefficient task flow:** *Requires multiple steps/screens to make quick status updates*
        - **Outdated interface:** *The visually cluttered design makes it feel unintuitive.*
        - **Limited options:** *Lacks 1/2 star ratings, limiting detailed feedback.*

- **Developing a user persona**
    - Using the insights from App Store reviews, I created a user persona to guide the design process. This persona represents a typical Goodreads user who is frustrated by the app's limitations and seeks a better user experience.
        - **Hey, I’m Win.** I am a college student that loves to read in my free time. I primarily use Goodreads to rate and review books I’ve read and find new books to read.
        - Pain Points:
            - Unappealing interfaces
            - Limited rating options
            - Reading slumps
        - Needs:
            - To easily log books
            - To rate ½ stars
            - To connect with fellow readers
    
### Ideate

- **Logging a book with the original app flow**
    - Focusing on the primary task of logging a book, I created an app flow for the existing Goodreads experience. I noted that the task required too many screens and interactions, making it slow for users wanting to log or update a book's status quickly.

- **A new simplified wire flow**
    - I created wireframes with a redesigned task flow, reducing the number of screens involved and implementing an overlay where users can change their reading status, rate the book, and write a review—all in one screen.

- **A playful rebrand**
    - To add personality, I developed a squid mascot linked to the name "Inkwell," connecting the ink on a book's page to the ink of a squid. The playful mascot offers users a memorable experience. I sketched the squid design on Procreate, iterating in Illustrator and Figma to customize it for different literary genres.

### Prototype

- **The interaction design**
    - My goal was to create an intuitive, effortless experience while still incorporating a bit of personality. I designed playful interactions that enhance, rather than distract, the user. For example, 'Ink it' buttons on book pages reveal a themed squid Easter egg, while the navigation bar animates to mimic ink flow.

-  **Keeping interactions simple**
    - I learned the importance of simplicity in interactions. Initially, I considered adding water droplets as feedback after pressing buttons like 'Paused' or 'Did Not Finish.' However, I realized that this could clutter the experience. Instead, I opted for a clean solution where pressing a button fills it with color, providing immediate visual feedback without distraction. Peer feedback reinforced that this approach enhanced usability and kept interactions smooth.

- **The final IX flow**
    - After iterating my original wire flow, I created a final IX flow with high-fidelity UI, which guided the final animation/prototype.

### Test

- **A group critique**
    - Since the final deliverable was an animation, I couldn’t conduct user testing. Instead, I participated in a group critique, which provided valuable insights.
        - 100% believed the playful branding and mascot added a fun element to the app
        - 100% believed the new reading statuses and task flow enhanced the user experience

### Execution 

- **The UI animation**
    - Although I have experience with After Effects, I experimented with Figma animation plugins like Fable and Figmotion before settling on Jitter, which offered the best MP4 quality downloads and a quick workflow.

- **The final animation**
    - Check out the final walkthrough of logging a book with Inkwell!

- **Features**
    1. **Enhanced reading status options**
        - Users can now select from nuanced reading statuses such as "Currently Reading," "Paused," and "Did Not Finish." This allows for more detailed tracking of reading progress.
    2. **1/2 star ratings**
        - Unlike the traditional full-star rating system, Inkwell introduces 1/2 star ratings, allowing users to give more precise feedback on the books they've read.
    3. **Streamlined book logging**
        - A new overlay interface enables users to log books, update statuses, rate, and write reviews all from a single screen, reducing unnecessary steps and improving usability.
    4. **Playful mascot**
        - Inkwell introduces a squid mascot that adapts to different genres, adding personality to the app and helping users identify literary categories visually.

### Reflection

- **Always consider the user**
    - I realized that designing for a social app like Inkwell requires a focus on user experience. The new reading status options directly respond to users' desires for nuanced tracking. And by keeping interactions simple and feedback clear, I was able to seamlessly integrate these features to the app.

- **Conducting usability tests**
    - Because the final prototype is an animation, I couldn’t conduct real user testing. In the future, I’d like to adapt this prototype in Figma and allow users to test the interactions themselves! 

- **Expanding other app features**
    - While this project focused specifically on the task flow of book logging, I’m excited about the potential for expanding into other features within the app, such as yearly reading goals, found on the home screen. Exploring how users can set and track their goals could add engagement and motivation, enhancing the overall Inkwell experience.

## Bali Sun Tours 

**Subheading:** Your sunlit adventure begins here

### Overview

- **Tools:** 
    - Figma, Procreate, Excel

- **Timeline:** 
    - 20 Weeks

- **Role:** 
    - Solo - UI/UX Design, Prototyping, Heuristic Evaluation

- **Deliverables:** 
    - High-Fidelity Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile UI

- **At a glance:** 
    - This project is a redesign of the Bali Sun Tours website to help plan your next island adventure. It features 9 pages with entirely new UI that improves navigation, information architecture, and visual appeal across 3 screens: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### Empathize

- **The current site**
    - Bali Sun Tours offers many activities for every user’s Bali getaway, but it can be difficult to sift through all their options due to its inconsistent and distracting user interface.

### Define 

- **Project goals** 
    - After analyzing the current site, I outlined the three main goals of this redesign.
        - **Information architechture:** *Create a consistent, user-friendly navigation menu for seamless browsing.*
            - The original site lacks a top navigation menu, making it difficult for users to explore available tours. The redesign will prioritize placing the menu at the top for easy access, replacing the footer-based navigation that confuses users.
         - **Visual design:** *Develop a playful and vibrant design theme to stand out from the competition*
             - Many tour websites adopt a minimalistic and generic visual style. The redesign will introduce a colorful and engaging aesthetic that reflects the adventure and excitement of Bali, differentiating Bali Sun Tours from similar websites.
         - **Language and Text:** *Improve the clarity and appeal of website text, ensuring consistent formatting.*
             - The current site has confusing text due to translation errors and inconsistent formatting. The redesign will focus on rewriting the content to be more enticing and accessible while ensuring uniform text styling, avoiding random highlights and inconsistent colors.

- **Understanding the user**
    - I created a user persona of a typical Bali visitor to guide the redesign.
        - **Hi there, I’m Lia!** I’m a business analyst living in Melbourne, Australia. I’m a bit of a workaholic, so any time i get to relax is when I’m the happiest. I love to travel with my husband, and we especially love the beach. My hobbies include photography, yoga, and sight seeing. I would also love to start a travel blog. I am a very curious person, and I’m always looking for an adventure!
        - Pain Points:
            - Confusing descriptions of products
            - Lack of customer reviews
            - Visually unappealing websites
        - Needs:
            - To make career connections
            - To explore different cultures
            - To keep a good work-life balance
    
### Ideate
- **Wireframe iteration**
    - With the project's long timeline, iteration was key. I developed several wireframes to test different interface designs, exploring various layouts before refining the final one.

- **Rebranding**
    - I experimented with multiple logos and color palettes before landing on a vibrant look. The final theme was inspired by sunshine and warmth, reflecting Bali’s tropical vibe. I also created custom illustrations to further distinguish Bali Sun Tours from competitors.


### Prototype

- **A call to action**
    - When designing the hero, I wanted users to know exactly what to do. The original site’s hero was a slideshow and search form. My decision was to include a “Book Now” button to clearly outline the main user goal: purchasing a tour. The large welcome text also encourages users to complete this goal.

-  **Streamlining the tour page**
    - To ensure users remained focused on booking a tour, I designed a booking component that stays fixed as users scroll through the page. This persistent element keeps the booking option accessible at all times, allowing users to easily make their decision without needing to search for the call to action. Additionally, I reorganized the information layout, making key details clear and visible throughout the user journey.

- **The navigation menu**
    - Redesigning the menu was a major focus. The original site categorized tours in a non-intuitive way, frustrating users. My solution was to create a traditional dropdown menu under the label “Our Tours.” This change greatly improved navigation in my evaluations.

### Test

- **Conducting heuristic evaluations**
    - I asked three subjects to evaluate the original site and then my prototype and score them based off of various criteria, and my prototype scored a significant 44% higher than the original.
        - 12/12 Visual design 
        - 12/12 Navigation
        - 12/12 Content

### Execution 
- **Check out the final prototype!**
    - Although I have experience with After Effects, I experimented with Figma animation plugins like Fable and Figmotion before settling on Jitter, which offered the best MP4 quality downloads and a quick workflow.

### Reflection
- **Embracing iteration**
    - Iteration played a crucial role throughout this 20-week project. By the end, I had created a completely different website than what I had initially envisioned, and I’m glad I embraced the process. I learned the value of not sticking to the first idea, allowing myself to build on concepts, improvise, and revisit each step throughout the design process.

- **Improving evaluation methods**
    - At first, I struggled with defining what to evaluate. I kept the scope too broad, asking my subjects to score too many categories, some of which only applied to the original site and not my prototype. Looking back, I would narrow the focus and provide more specific tasks for users to complete. I would also be more diligent in organizing the evaluation criteria, ensuring that the feedback collected directly aligned with the goals of my prototype. This would help streamline the evaluation process and yield more actionable insights.

## Amazon Wireframes

**Subheading:** Ending shopping cart abandonment

### Overview

- **Tools:** 
    - Balsamiq

- **Timeline:** 
    - 2 Weeks

- **Role:** 
    - UX Design, Prototyping

- **Deliverables:** 
    - Low-Fidelity Prototype

- **At a glance:** 
    - This project focuses on Amazon.com’s shopping cart page and how it can be improved to reduce shopping cart abadonment. The prototype includes new features that solve issues with feedback, discoverability, and affordance, creating a more fulfilling experience for shoppers.

### Empathize

- **What is shopping cart abandonment?**
    - Shopping cart abandonment occurs when users add items to their cart but never complete the purchase, abandoning their carts. This misaligniment with Amazon’s business goals prompted the question: How might we encourage users to complete their purchases?

### Define 

- **The pain points** 
    - After analyzing the current interface, I narrowed down three actionable pain points that align with UX heuristics
        - **Discoverability:** *Users need to scroll excessively to view their browsing history and saved items, which are buried below the shopping cart. This layout is not user-friendly, especially when the cart has many items.*
        - **Feedback:** *Providing good feedback is essential. The original site lacks a visible count of items in the cart while on the shopping cart page itself and provides no estimated cost feedback.*
        - **Affordance:** *Many e-commerce sites allow users to input discount codes or gift cards before checkout, helping them make decisions before payment. Amazon lacks this feature on the shopping cart page*

### Prototype

- **Improving discoverability**
    - The first change I proposed was improving the discoverability of the "Your Items" and "Browsing History" sections. In my wireframe, I added a clickable “Your Items” link next to “Shopping Cart” that directs users to a separate page with this information, rather than forcing them to scroll down. This separate page also includes a navigation menu with links to browsing history and recommended products based on algorithms and customer reviews.
    - The "Your Items" section includes "Saved for later" and "Buy Again" items, but in the original layout, it was positioned below the fold, making it less visible. This forces users to scroll more, especially if their cart is large, which distracts them from completing their purchase.




-  **Providing feedback**
    - My second suggestion addressed two feedback-related issues:
        - **Item count:** In my design, I added a “(#)” next to “Shopping Cart,” making the number of items in the cart more visible. This provides users with immediate context and reduces their need to look elsewhere, such as the icon in the menu bar, for feedback.
        - **Estimated total:** I added more information about costs, such as taxes and shipping fees, which the original design lacked. By providing this transparent cost breakdown, users are less likely to feel surprised and more likely to complete their purchase.

- **Affordance for discount codes**
    - The third improvement I implemented was the affordance for entering gift cards, vouchers, or promotional codes directly on the shopping cart page. Currently, Amazon only allows this on the checkout page. By including an input field for discount codes earlier, users can see their savings before reaching checkout, reducing the likelihood of them leaving to find promo codes and abandoning their cart.

### Reflection

- **The benefits of rapid prototyping**
    - This project allowed me to practice rapid prototyping using Balsamiq, which was beneficial as it kept my focus on user experience without being distracted by visual design. This helped me quickly explore and validate solutions for the pain points identified.


- **Future testing**
    - Since this project focused only on low-fidelity prototyping, I wasn't able to test these designs with real users. I'd be interested to see how these solutions could impact real user behavior and improve consumer engagement rates.
